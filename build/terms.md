Formal takedown notices must be sent to [copyright@libscie.org](mailto:copyright@libscie.org) and must enumerate all claims as exactly as possible. By sending a takedown notice, you agree to public disclosure of the takedown notice (we will redact any information regarding natural persons). We will not take into account any claims that do not have a [preponderance of evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)#Preponderance_of_the_evidence).

# Data policy

Our policy is to minimize information we collect about you or your devices when you use Hypergraph. We also, within reason, minimize who has access to these personal data and how long we store the information. We make a distinction between active data collection and passive data collection. 

We use the following third parties to provide you with functionality in Hypergraph and process the resulting data:

- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/)
- [Chatra](https://chatra.com/privacy-policy/)
- [Cloud68](https://cloud68.co/legal/privacy-policy)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/privacy-policy/)
- [Google App Suite](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Privacy-Policy-3468d120cf614d4c9014c09f6adc9091)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de/privacy)

Please see their respective privacy policies to understand what information they store and how. We do not actively share any of the collected information outside Liberate Science GmbH.

## Information collected

We collect statistics regarding how you use Hypergraph, except when you opt out during setup. We have specifically chosen to reduce accuracy of our statistics to optimize respect for your privacy. Information we collect is:

- Device information (browser, operating system, screen size, partial IP address [two bytes anonymized])
- Pages visited per session
- Links followed per session
- Duration of visit per session

We store our raw data for 365 days, after which it is automatically deleted.

We provide some active ways for you to share information with us. You can assume we store that information unless you ask us to remove it or use the option to remove it yourself. Specifically, we give you the option to...

- ...share your email address with us ðŸ’Œ
- ...share a name and any questions you might have through our Chatra integration

Note that the services we use have passive data collection in place that we might have access to as well. Most notably is our Chatra integration, which provides us with real-time access on:

- Amount of users
- Geographical location of user
- Page user is viewing
- Previous page
- Operating system

## Information not collected

To protect your data and give you full control over the information we collect from you, we explicitly do not integrate the following on our Pages:

- ...analytics cookies
- ...cross-site trackers
- ...fingerprinting cookies

We do not store individual level data without consent.

## Information exposed

By using Hypergraph, you publicly announce your IP address to other users. This means that other people can create logs of which IP is accessing which content. We cannot control who does so. You agree to not hold Liberate Science liable in any and all claims or damages that are the result of your usage of Hypergraph.

## Data request

We think it is important for you to be in control of your data. You as a natural person can always reach us under [privacy@libscie.org](mailto:privacy@libscie.org) with questions about data regarding you. This email address also serves as an entry point for your GDPR requests, if you have one.

The person responsible for all the data handling at Liberate Science GmbH is Chris Hartgerink, who you can reach directly at [chris@libscie.org](mailto:chris@libscie.org) or +49 162 68 18 225 if you have any concerns you would like to address immediately.

# Hypergraph Vault

By enabling the Hypergraph Vault, you agree that we store information about the content you share indefinitely. You also agree that this information is made publicly available.

Information stored includes, but is not limited to, the unique content address on the Hypercore protocol, time content was deposited into the Hypergraph Vault, and copies of all files that you shared while the Hypergraph Vault is enabled, including each file's history (i.e., prior versions).

You agree that by disabling the Hypergraph Vault, any content shared while the Hypergraph Vault was enabled, will remain part of the Hypergraph Vault indefinitely.

In case we receive a takedown notice (see "Copyright violations" section), we may remove public access to the respective content from the Hypergraph Vault, in case this takedown is considered viable.

# Jurisdiction

You agree that this agreement with Liberate Science is governed by German law. 

You agree that legal proceedings against Liberate Science GmbH surrounding your use of Hypergraph will be brought and arbitrated in German court, in accordance with German law.
